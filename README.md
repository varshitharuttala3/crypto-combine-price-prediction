# Crypto Combined Price Prediction

## Problem Statement
Predict the future prices of multiple cryptocurrencies using historical market data and machine learning techniques.

## Cryptocurrencies Used
- Bitcoin (BTC)
- Ethereum (ETH)
- Binance Coin (BNB)
- Cardano (ADA)
- Ripple (XRP)

## Dataset
Historical cryptocurrency price data containing:
- Open price
- Close price
- High and low prices
- Trading volume
(Data collected from public crypto market datasets)

## Approach
- Data collection for multiple cryptocurrencies
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation

## Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Google Colab

## Results
The model successfully learns price trends across different cryptocurrencies and provides reasonable price predictions.

## Future Improvements
- Apply LSTM and deep learning models
- Add technical indicators (RSI, MACD)
- Improve time-series forecasting
- Include real-time price data
